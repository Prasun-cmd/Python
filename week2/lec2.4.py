             # Variable naming in python
# we can use alphanumeric charcater and underscore as variable name
# uppercase and lowercase are different
#variable name starts with alphabet or underscore but not number

#swap the variable 

x,y=1,2
print(x,y)
x,y=y,x
print(x,y)

#delete a variable

a=10
print(a)
del(a)

#short hand technique use to minimize the variable name

count=0
count+=1
count+=1
print(count)

#serach operator

print('can' in 'a person can learnt beyond ones limit')
print('should' in 'a person can learn only what they want to learn')

#chaining operation when more than one logical operator are used

t=5
print(10>t<15)
print(t<15<t*4>2)
